Datasets for Link-Level Problems
===================================

----------------------------------
Bitcoin-OTC (Link Classification)
----------------------------------

The dataset `Bitcoin-OTC <https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html>`_ is a who-trust-whom network, where nodes are users
of a bitcoin-trading platform. Each directed edge has an integer rating between âˆ’10 to 10 and a
timestamp. The ratings are divided into 6 groups. Two of them are used separately for Task-IL
and accumulated for Class-IL. For Time-IL, we formulate 7 tasks using the timestamps, where the
signs of the ratings are used as binary classes. Since there is no external node feature, we use in-degrees
and out-degrees as node features.

Statistics:

- Nodes: 5,881
- Edges: 35,592
- Number of Classes: 21 
- Supported Incremental Settings:
   
   + Task-IL with 3 tasks
   + Class-IL with 3 tasks
   + Time-IL with 7 tasks

Wiki-CS (Link Prediction)
------------------------------

`Wiki-CS <https://github.com/pmernyei/wiki-cs-dataset>`_ is a hyperlink network between computer science articles.
Each article has a label indicating one of the 10 subfields that it belongs to. For Domain-IL, the
node labels are used as domains, and specifically, the edges are divide into 54 groups, according
to the labels of their endpoints.

Statistics:

- Nodes: 11,701
- Edges: 431,726
- Number of Classes: 2
- Number of Node Features: 300
- Supported Incremental Settings:
   
   + Domain-IL with 54 tasks

------------------------------
ogbl-collab (Link Prediction)
------------------------------

`ogbl-collab <https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-collab>`_ s a co-authorship network, where nodes are
authors. We use publication years to form 50 groups for the Time-IL setting. Due to the imbalance on the publication years of the considered papers, we constructed formed the first task using the paper published before 1971. From the second task, we constructed the `i`-th task with the paper published in `1969 + i`.
Each node feature is obtained by averaging the word embeddings of published papers.

Statistics:

- Nodes: 235,868
- Edges: 1,285,465
- Number of Classes: 2
- Number of Node Features: 128
- Supported Incremental Settings:
   
   + Time-IL with 50 tasks

------------------------------
facebook (Link Prediction)
------------------------------

`facebook <https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/datasets#facebook-page-page-networks>`_ is a social network, where nodes are pages of Facebook, and its class belongs to one
among 8 categories. Edges indicate mutual likes among the pages, and they exist only between
pages within the same category. We divide the edges into 8 groups, according to the labels of their
endpoints. We make the graph to be undirected, and since there is no external node feature, we use degrees as node features.

Statistics:

- Nodes: 134,833
- Edges: 1,380,293
- Number of Classes: 2
- Number of Node Features: 1
- Supported Incremental Settings:
   
   + Domain-IL with 8 tasks

askubuntu (Link Prediction)
------------------------------

Nodes in `askubuntu <http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-askubuntu.html>`_ are users of askubuntu, and edges indicate there is interaction between the
users. The edges are divided into 69 groups according to the timestamps for Time-IL. Specifically, we constructed the tasks with the papers published in the same month. We make the graph to be undirected, and since there is no external node feature, we use degrees as node features.

Statistics:

- Nodes: 159,313
- Edges: 507,988
- Number of Classes: 2
- Number of Node Features: 1
- Supported Incremental Settings:
   
   + Time-IL with 69 tasks
