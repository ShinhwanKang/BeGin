Tutorial
===================================


In this material, we briefly describe how to perform graph continual learning with BeGin using some examples.

Step 0. Prepare Continual Learning Scenario
--------

BeGin provides various benchmark scenarios based on graph-related problems and incremental settings for continual learning. Currently, BeGin supports the following four graph-related problems and four incremental settings for continual learning with graph data.

- Node Classification (NC)
- Link Classification (LC)
- Link Prediction (LP)
- Graph Classification (GC)
